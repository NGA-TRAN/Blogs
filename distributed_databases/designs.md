# Designs of Open-source and Commercial Distributed (Cloud) Databases

More useful readings will be added time to time

--------------------------------------

These are papers, journals and talks by DB researchers and builders that I find worth learning if you want to join the DB-builder community or even build your own DB. Some papers cover high-level architecture of a DB, some describe a major DB component in depth, some illustrate certain techniques to build or improve a specific sub-component. If you have never read any of these, you may want to start with the [Basic Readings](basic_readings.md) instead. Each paper will include a short/nick name, year of publishing, full title and a brief summary.
