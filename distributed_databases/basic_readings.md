# Reading Materials for Building Distributed (Cloud) Databases

More useful readings will be added time to time

--------------------------------------

These are classes, papers, journals or books written by DB researchers and builders that provide basic Database knowledge and references for you to understand how a database works and is built. If you have never read any of these, start from the top.


## Basic Distributed System Readings
* [System Design](https://www.amazon.com/System-Design-Interview-Insiders-Guide-ebook/dp/B08B3FWYBX) - 2020 - "System Design Interview - An Insider's Guide" by Alex Xu
A book that covers high-level designs of distributed systems, and, although it does not focus on DB, it introduces challenges all DB builders want to solve and relevant technologies used to do solve them. I highly recommend you to read at least the first half of this book in the order the chapters are laid out before reading the following materials.
* [System Design 2](https://www.amazon.com/System-Design-Interview-Insiders-Guide-ebook/dp/B0CR977BQH/) - 2022 - "System Design Interview â€“ An Insider's Guide: Volume 2" by Alex Xu & Sahn Lam

* [MIT 6.2824 Distributed System](http://nil.csail.mit.edu/6.824/2020/) and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/@6.824) - 2020 by Prof. Robert Morris
   - MapReduce
   - GFS
   - Fault Tolerence: Raft & Zookeeper
      - Raft: leader & replicas with majority-vote strategy, 2-face locking
   - Cloud Replicated Aurora DB: 6 replicas on 3 data centers
   - Cache Consistency: Frangipani
   - Distributed Transactions: 2-face commit
   - Spanner
     - Uses Paxos (replicas without leader) with 2-face locking
     - 2-face commit for writes (the Pasox replicas & 2-face locking helps avoid network issue & waiting forever during 2-face commit)
     - Snapshot isolation for reads
     - Use Synchronized clocks 
   - Optimistic Concurrency Control vs Pessimistic Conurrency Control
     - Pessimistic: Lock involved items to guarantee serial transaction
     - Optimistic: No locking but at commit time check version/epoch and cancel the transaction if it was changed
   - Big Data: Spark (~second generation of map reduce) 
     - Partition data and build a plan (DAG) on each partition. 
     - The plan can merge/re-distribute/broadcast data from different partitions --> save before data redistribution to reuse at recovery as needed
   - Cache Conconsitency: Memcached at FB
   - Causal Concsistency & COPS
   - Fork Consistency
   - Certificate Transparency
   - Bitcoin
   - Blockstack

* [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321) - 2017 by Martin Kleppmann
A thick book that describes a various sets of technologies used to design not only DBs but data-intensive applications. It is recommended to only read a little bit of this book everyday while reading the other materials, or use it as a reference to fill your missing knowledge. Without specific use cases for your designs, you will get lost easily in this book.
