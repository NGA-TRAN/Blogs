# Blogs

These blogs were written for my pleasure, but I hope you will enjoy them too. The contents came from my own experience and readings. Most of them were reviewed by experts in the respective fields before being published here; however, it is inevitable to convey inaccurate information sometimes. If you have feedback or are interested in exchanging ideas, I am more than happy to hear from you at nga dash tran at live dot com. <span style="color: red;"> The blogs are aimed to point out trade-offs and issues that are neither available nor discussed deeply enough and throw out some questions and thoughts for future designs. </span> At the beginning of each post, there will be links to the topic's related documents.


**_Distributed Cloud Databases_** is the current focus and I aim to provide materials for (1) basic readings, classes and references; (2) designs of Open-source and Commercial Databases; (3) technical talks; and (4) topics to be written. If you are interested in specific topics that you think I will be able to provide but are not listed, please email me. Here is [my brief background and experience](about_me.md). I found that each of my recent posts was a combination of many topics I had planned to write in different posts. Based on the context of the new designs in the current market, I have discovered it is more comprehensive to put many topics together in a more general context. Enjoy the readings!
