* Why are tools for system monitoring and log analysis top priority?
* The roles of three major components of a DB: Query Optimizer, Execution Engine, and Storage.
* Elastic throughput scaling vs elastic crunch scaling. Should we have a design that supports both?
* Transaction Isolation: Serial Execution vs Two-Phase Locking vs Serialization Snapshot Isolation
* Storage for availability, scaling, and performance. _Many possible subtopics_:
    * Segmentation vs Partitioning.
    * Segments vs Shards.
    * Fault Tolerance: buddy projections vs buddy subscription.
    * Hierarchical partitioning for hot and cold data.
* Why Query Optimizer and Execution go hand in hand? _Many possible subtopics_:
    * Global plan vs Local plan vs Execution plan.
    * Predicate push-down & SIPS.
    * Group-by push-down vs Group-by Pipeline.
    * Partition Prunning.
* Why does column-stored DB need a built-in & auto-run Database Designer?
* Materialized Views: What are specific use cases for the right designs?
    * Flattened Table vs Live Aggregate Projection
